I want to rethink my archetypes and buildarounds; I feel like blue now has a ton of buildaround jank, whereas red just has pure value. Maybe I can assign one value archetype and one buildaround archetype to each color pair, as well as to each color itself? Maybe to colorless as well, or color-artifact pairs?
